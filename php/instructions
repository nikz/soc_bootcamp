Side A: PHP
===========

Alright, let's get started. Everyone has been to song lyric sites before right? The ones that have like a million ads for stupid smilies and shit that pop up all over the lyrics you're trying to read?

Well, we're going to pretend we never discovered AdBlock, and we're going to build a lyrics site that doesn't suck.

Then we'll sell it to Google for eleventy billion dollars and retire to Fiji on our party Jet. All in 2 easy steps (it's a recession, we couldn't afford 3)

(Step 1) "I should have known better"

Open new_song.php. This is a skeleton file that's going to help you out quite a lot.

Read through it, check that you kinda understand what's going on. I'll walk you through.

  - <?php tells PHP "start paying attention to this bit - it's PHP code"
  - ?> tells PHP "fuggetaboutit, this next bit is plain text/html, no need to do anything to it"
  
  - $variable defines a variable in PHP. Is it an int? Is it a String? Is it float? No! It's all of these things, and more!
    PHP is Dynamically Typed. That means you don't have to tell PHP what kind of variable you want store, it'll just figure
    things out on its own. Awesome, huh?
    
  - function somename($arg1, $arg2, $arg3...) defines - Gold Star for you! - a function! The important thing to note here is the lack
    of type declaration. That's because PHP (pretty much) doesn't care about types! (A function is roughly analogous to a method inside
    a class. You can create classes and methods in PHP, but we're not going to bother, because I'm lazy. And OOP is PHP is more painful
    than that busker guy in Manners Mall who wears the Indian Feather cap).
    
  - no prizes for guessing what die() and exit() do
  
  - $_POST is a Superglobal. It basically contains all the POST variables that are sent back from your form.
  
  - If you want to check what value is in a variable, try using var_dump
  
  - Try entering a song with an apostrope (') or speech mark ("). Oh noes! Look up mysql_escape_string...

  - check everything is working using the mysql client on your command line (mysql -u user -p -h host, then type your pwd)
  
  - the PHP manual is a lovely thing - http://nz.php.net/manual/en/
  
(Step 2) "While everybody else refrained - Uncle Johnny did cocaine"

Well, would ya look at that. You're on your way to internet fame and the adoration of geeks everywhere. 

Check out songs.php.

Hmmm, that's a bit of a let down. What, you thought I was gonna hold your hand all the way through? 

This is a bootcamp, not primary school soldier!

Get cracking. I want that <HEAD> clean enough that I could eat off it!

(Extra For Experts) "Don't you love her as she's walking out the door?"

Well, it would be really awesome to be able to delete a song. Sometimes I feel like I've heard that new Lily Allen song enough already, and I just want
to erase it from existence.

You will need (in no particular order):

   - One (1) Database connection
   - One (1) Delete query
   - One (1) header() call
   - You probably won't need any HTML
   - (optionally) you could have a $_GET variable (/myfile.php?getname=getval) that displays a nice confirmation message - "that song is GONE. FOREVER. Come here, it's okay. I know this is an emotional time for you."
    Something like that.
    
FIN.
